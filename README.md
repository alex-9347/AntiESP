## ✨ Features
- Blocks visibility below Y=0
- Prevents ESP / Freecam advantages
- Client-side only (no world changes)
- No performance-heavy calculations

---

## 🔧 How It Works
- **Above Y=5**  
  The client receives **fake block updates**, forcing everything below Y=0 to render as **Deepslate**.

- **Below Y=5**  
  Real blocks are sent again and the world renders normally.

All changes are handled **client-side** using ProtocolLib.

---

## 📦 Dependencies
- **ProtocolLib** `5.4+`

---

## 🧠 Use Case
Perfect for:
- SMP servers
- Anti-cheat setups
- Preventing underground ESP abuse

## 🚀 Status
Actively developed & performance-focused.
